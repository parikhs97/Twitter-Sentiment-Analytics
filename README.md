# Twitter-Sentiment-Analytics
Basic Twitter Sentiment Analytics using Apache Spark Streaming APIs and Python

**Background**

In this project, you will be processing streaming data in real time. One of the first requirements is to get access to the streaming data; in this case, tweets. We will be simulating real-time streaming of tweets so that we have a consistent dataset.

In addition, you will also be using Kafka to buffer the tweets before processing. Kafka provides a distributed queuing service which can be used to store the data when the data creation rate is more than processing rate. It also has several other uses. Read about the basics of Kafka (Introductionup to QuickStart) from the official documentation.

Finally, as an introduction to stream processing API provided by Spark, read the programming guide from the beginning up to, and including, the section on discretized streams (DStreams). Pay special attention to the “quick example” as it will be fairly similar to this project.
